Predicting and understanding obesity levels using explainable ensemble learning

# ðŸ§  Smart Obesity Predictor

This project predicts obesity levels using a soft-voting ensemble of decision tree-based models. The ensemble includes a biased model to improve performance on underrepresented classes.

## ðŸ“¦ Models Used

- LightGBM
- XGBoost
- Random Forest (biased toward weak classes)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open the notebook in Colab  
   

2. Run all cells from top to bottom.

3. View the classification report and confusion matrix.
